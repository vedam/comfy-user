### Can I use the outputs I’m creating with a [dev] model commercially with a FLUX [dev] Self-Hosted Commercial License?

Yes! But there are a few caveats. The FLUX [dev] Self-Hosted Commercial License Terms allow you to use the [dev] model and outputs from the model commercially, and we make no ownership claim over those outputs. However, we do not make representations or warranties with respect to the contents of that output. So, it will be your responsibility to determine whether those contents may be used, or are appropriate for, commercial usage.

### What can I do with a [dev] model with a FLUX [dev] Self-Hosted Commercial License?

A lot! You can self-host a FLUX [dev] model and integrate that FLUX [dev] model and derivatives (such as LORAs) of that [dev] model with your app or website. You can also fine-tune, create LORAs, or other derivatives of that FLUX [dev] model and offer them to your users. Please review the FLUX [dev] Self-Hosted Commercial License Terms for the full license details.
